# bootstrappingWithNoise
Bootstrapping with noise for the evaluation of distance based concept trees

In this program the approach of bootstrapping with noise to evaluate the distance-based concept trees described in chapter 4.1.4. in Köllner (to appear) is coded.

This alternate method, described in Nerbonne (2008), can be transferred to the task of distance-based concept tree evaluation.
